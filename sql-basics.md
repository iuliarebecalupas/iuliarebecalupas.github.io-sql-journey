Welcome to the starting point of learning SQL!  
This chapter introduces the key concepts you need to understand before writing any SQL code.

## What is SQL?

**SQL** stands for **Structured Query Language**.  
It is the standard language used to **communicate with relational databases**.  
With SQL, you can:

- Retrieve data from a database
- Insert new data
- Update or delete existing data
- Create or change the structure of database objects (like tables)

## Why Do We Need SQL?

Humans and computers don’t speak the same language.

When we ask questions like:

> “Can you show me all customers who placed an order in the last week?”

...a human understands this easily. But a machine doesn’t.

Computers need **clear**, **precise**, and **structured instructions** to fetch the right data.

This is where **SQL** comes in.

SQL gives us a way to **translate our questions into a format** the database can understand.
